The utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in education has surged, leading to a rise in published studies. Despite this, comprehensive large-scale reviews in this field are lacking. This study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing 4,519 publications from 2000 to 2019, using topic-based bibliometrics to identify trends and topics related to AI applications in education (AIEd). Results indicate a growing interest in using AI for educational purposes within the academic community. The primary research topics include intelligent tutoring systems for special education, natural language processing for language education, educational robots for AI education, educational data mining for performance prediction, discourse analysis in computer-supported collaborative learning, neural networks for teaching evaluation, affective computing for learner emotion detection, and recommender systems for personalized learning. The study also addresses the challenges and future directions of AIEd.
