This study is conducted to investigate the empathy between human-chatbot interactions among computer science students at Uppsala University, Sweden. This is done by exploring how participants perceived anthropomorphic chatbots as machines or humans, the existence of verbal abuse during human-chatbot interactions, and the expectation of chatbot helpfulness depending on gender dynamics. A semi-structured interview methodology with five students were conducted for qualitative data collection. The collected data is manually analyzed using thematic analysis. The results of this study find that there was empathy in human-chatbot interaction, regardless of whether participants perceive anthropomorphic chatbots as humans or machines. However, the level of empathy was generally low as participants become frustrated when they were dissatisfied with the response of chatbots and exit the chatbots without expressing their frustration. They usually forgot their frustration and came again with other questions another time. The study also showed that participants may expect more help and politeness if chatbots are more likely to be female.
