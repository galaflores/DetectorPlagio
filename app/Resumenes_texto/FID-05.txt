Internet of Things (IoT) based remote healthcare applications provided fast and preventative medical services to the patients at risk. However, predicting heart disease was a complex task and diagnosis results were rarely accurate. To address this issue, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been proposed for providing prior diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac diseases. Initially, the physiological data were collected from the patient’s remotely by using the four bio sensors such as ECG sensor, Pressure sensor, Pulse sensor and Glucose sensor. An Arduino controller received the collected data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. A cardiovascular disease prediction model was implemented by using BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model which diagnosed the cardiovascular disease and classified into five available cardiovascular classes. The recommendation system provided physical and dietary recommendations to cardiac patients based on the classified data, via user mobile application. The performance of the DEEP-CARDIO was validated by Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) using the real-time Framingham’s and Statlog heart disease dataset. The proposed DEEP CARDIO method achieved an overall accuracy of 99.90% whereas, the MABC-SVM, HCBDA and MLbPM method achieved 86.91%, 88.65% and 93.63% respectively.
