Accurately scientific disciplines, including biomechanics, genetics, ethology, and neurology, it is essential to accurately track the behavior of animals throughout studies, particularly without employing markers. However, it has proven difficult to extract precise stances from backgrounds that are always shifting. Recently, we unveiled an open-source toolset that makes use of a cutting-edge algorithm for estimating human position. With the help of this toolbox, users may train a deep neural network to accurately monitor user-defined features with tracking accuracy that rivals that of human labeling. We have added new features, including as graphical user interfaces (GUIs), efficiency improvements, and network refinement based on active learning, to this revised Python module. In order to help customers create a unique and repeatable analysis pipeline using a graphical processing unit (GPU).
