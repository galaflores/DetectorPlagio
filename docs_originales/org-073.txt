Fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation for an m-commerce mobile application is a process of measuring the usability of a mobile application by using fuzzy logic principles. The usability of any mobile application is used to find out the user experience of the mobile application by analyzing the user's expectations and preferences. Fuzzy logic always be the optimal choice for quantification. Fuzzy logic-based quantification of usability expectation assesses the user experience of an m-commerce mobile application by taking into account the user's needs, preferences, and expectations. Usability expectation also takes into account the ability of the user to understand and interact with the application, the degree to which the application meets the user's expectations, and the overall satisfaction with the application. This process helps to identify areas of improvement, enabling the developers to make necessary changes for a better user experience. This study presents to design of a usability metric framework and then quantifies the overall usability quality of an m-commerce mobile application with the help of fuzzy logic. The proposed usability metric framework is based on the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach and is intended to provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to design metrics to assess the qualitative aspect of mobile phone applications. The framework has been developed and tested in an m-commerce context and provides a set of measurable criteria to quantify m-commerce mobile applications as per standard. The results of the evaluation can then be used to improve m-commerce mobile applications and to ensure that the user experience is optimized
