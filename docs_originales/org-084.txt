Smart cities represent the convergence of information and communication technologies (ICT) with urban management to improve the quality of life of city dwellers. In this context, recommender systems, tools that offer personalised suggestions to city dwellers, have emerged as key contributors to this convergence. Their successful application in various areas of city life and their ability to process massive amounts of data generated in urban environments has expedited their status as a crucial technology in the evolution of city planning. Our methodology included reviewing the Web of Science database, resulting in 130 articles that, filtered for relevancy, were reduced to 86. The first stage consisted of carrying out a bibliometric analysis with the objective of analysing structural aspects with the SciMAT tool. Secondly, a systematic literature review was undertaken using the PRISMA 2020 statement. The results illustrated the different processes by which recommendations are filtered in areas such as tourism, health, mobility, and transport. This research is seen as a significant breakthrough that can drive the evolution and efficiency of smart cities, establishing a solid framework for future research in this dynamic field.
