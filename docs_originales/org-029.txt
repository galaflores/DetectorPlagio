Face recognition has a very important role in various applications, from security, surveillance to authentication. For safety most of the household is having CC cameras such that they could recognize the persons from it. These CCTV are allocated for having safety and to know who visited their houses. In few highly secured places where allowance to any unknown intruder is strictly prohibited. Thereby, this paper deals with a system which could recognize the face of the intruder through surveillance camera using ML and AI based algorithms. The design specified is successfully implemented using HOG feature extraction and SVM classification algorithms and it classifies the faces for a video stream given as input. The major objective entitled to this paper is to recognize the faces of people from the video by HOG feature extractor and classify them using SVM and train the machine to tell who is the person working for the organization and who are the intruder.
