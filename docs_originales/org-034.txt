Artificial intelligence is one of the emerging technologies that simulate human intelligence in machines by programming it to think like human beings and mimic their actions. An autonomous vehicle can function itself and carry out necessary functions without any human involvement. This innovative technology may provide increased passenger safety, less congested roads, congestion reduction, optimum traffic, lower fuel consumption, less pollution, and better travel experiences. Autonomous vehicles play a vital role in industry, agriculture, transportation, and military applications. The autonomous vehicle's activities are supported by sensor data and a few artificial intelligence systems. Artificial intelligence is the collection of data, path planning, and execution in autonomous vehicles that require some machine learning techniques that are a part of artificial intelligence. But this comes with some privacy issues and security concerns. Security is an important concern for autonomous vehicles. The issues of cybersecurity while incorporating artificial intelligence in autonomous vehicles will be covered in this article, along with the growing technology of self-driving automobiles.
