At present, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industrial control, smart home and other fields has received good response. However, AI technology has certain requirements for computer performance, and also faces problems in network security, data analysis, human-computer interaction, etc. At present, the visual platform of embedded system has achieved remarkable results in practical applications, but its development has been seriously hampered by problems such as low overall development efficiency and unstable system performance. This paper designed an EP Vision System (VS) based on AI technology. The platform combined the embedded hardware design with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to realize the intelligent robot interaction and target detection functions. The test results showed that when other conditions were the same, students and experts had 83.5% and 90% positive evaluations of System X, and 16.5% and 10% negative evaluations respectively. However, their positive evaluation of System Y only accounted for 19% and 4%, while the negative evaluation accounted for 81% and 96%. The proportion of positive evaluation of System X was much higher than that of System Y, which indicated that System X can meet the actual application requirements and improve the system recognition efficiency to a certain extent. It showed the positive relationship between AI technology and EP VS.
