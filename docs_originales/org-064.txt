This study examines the ethical challenges and regulatory dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in relation to data integrity and its influence on social dynamics. Employing a cross-sectional survey approach, primary data was collected from 650 AI practitioners across various sectors, encompassing developers, data scientists, ethicists, and policymakers. The study investigated the correlations between regulatory compliance, ethical awareness, professional training, and experience in AI practice with the effectiveness of AI implementation and data integrity. The findings revealed a strong positive correlation between higher levels of regulatory compliance and perceived effectiveness in AI implementation, as well as between AI ethics awareness and data integrity assurance. Moreover, a significant relationship was observed between professional training in AI and its positive impact on social dynamics. However, experience in the AI field, while positively correlated, showed a weaker link to data integrity, indicating that experience alone is insufficient for ensuring effective AI practices. The study highlights the importance of ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and professional training in shaping AI development and its societal implications. The need for dynamic, adaptable, and inclusive regulatory frameworks that can align AI practices with societal values and ethical norms is emphasized. Future research directions include exploring AI ethics and regulation in diverse cultural contexts and the impact of emerging technologies like quantum computing on AI ethics.
