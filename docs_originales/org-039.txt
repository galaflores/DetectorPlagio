Artificial intelligence is now a necessary component for both production and service systems in recent years, as technology has become a vital aspect of daily life. Automated driving vehicles operate autonomously, also known as driverless cars that can operate without a human driver. Research on autonomous vehicles has substantially advanced in recent years. Artificially intelligent autonomous vehicles are the current need of the society. Although some people might be apprehensive to give a computer control of their vehicle, automated driving technologies have the potential to make roads safer. Self-driving automobiles can address environmental issues as well as safety-related ones. Unlike humans, computers do not really have difficulty keeping attention when driving. Additionally, by responding appropriately, an automated car can prevent accidents to potentially dangerous events on the road. Self-driving technology has many advantages, one of which will make more easily accessible means of transport to people who are unable to drive. For a variety of reasons, such as inexperience, incapacity, or age, many people are unable to operate a vehicle. These individuals can travel considerably more safely and independently. Therefore, we will explore the architectures of both software and hardware of autonomous cars in this chapter, as well as their parts, benefits, and future developments.
