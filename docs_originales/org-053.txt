This chapter presents a systematic review on the relationship between artificial intelligence and emotions in education in Latin America and the Caribbean. The PRISMA systematic review methodology was used to describe the state of the situation of research on this topic, taking into account theories, methodologies, countries, and educational levels. Fifteen published articles were finally selected, focusing on Brazil and Colombia, university level, students as unit of analysis, methodologies based on facial recognition, psychology and software combined. It is hoped to deepen the research in other disciplines, with other theories and methodologies.
