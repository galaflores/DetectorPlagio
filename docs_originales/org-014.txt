The sphere of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is quite wide. There are many individual and collaborative AI-based technologies available. One of them is computer vision technology. Computer vision is also related to other technologies: Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial neural networks, etc. Computer vision is applied in many different areas. One of the areas where it has been widely applied in recent times is healthcare. In healthcare, various algorithms in the aforementioned technologies are used to obtain meaningful information from medical images. In this chapter, the concept of computer vision, its fields of application, and its application in healthcare are reviewed. Also, the example of tumor detection by computer vision in a MATLAB environment is considered.
