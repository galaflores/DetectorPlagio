Easy internet access and technological advancements have resulted in information overload and a plethora of options, making decision-making extremely difficult. Recommender System (RS) is a potential solution for assisting users in making decisions by recommending or predicting product ratings. Three fundamental forms of RS that use implicit or explicit feedback for recommendation are collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering. Ratings are the most common form of feedback, but product descriptions, reviews, images, audios, and videos are also important and can help improve the performance of the traditional RS. These additional variables can have a significant impact on RSâ€™s performance. Traditional RSs used approaches based on the nearest neighbor or other machine learning models, but thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, RSs are now being developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which can efficiently exploit auxiliary information. In addition to comparing CNN-based RSs on common grounds, this article provides a full examination of CNN-based RSs and how they might use various types of auxiliary information. The study also discusses data characteristics, data statistics, and auxiliary information in a variety of publicly available datasets. Different evaluation measures for RSs are also discussed, and readers are provided with interesting challenges and open research issues.
