In this paper, Self-Reproduction characteristic of Artificial Life is introduced to computer animation. A Self-Reproduction model of Artificial Fish based on gene control is put forward and built. Based on Artificial Fish's phenotype, the contents of its chromosome are given. Based on this model, heredity rules are given. Artificial Fish could reproduce and grow in the virtual marine environment freely controlled by the gene model and rules. Artificial behaviors include predefined behaviors and nondeterminate behaviors. Cognitive models based on Artificial Intelligence is put forward and built to control behaviors of artificial fish in high level. Simulation program is designed and developed based on all these models built above. These made groundwork to improve the efficiency and automatic level of artificial fish animation.
