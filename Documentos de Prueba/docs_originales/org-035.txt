Throughout the last decades, the number of vehicles on the road has steadily increased due to the rising demand for urban mobility and contemporary logistics. Two of the many detrimental effects of more vehicles on the road, which also impede economic development, are increased traffic congestion and traffic accidents. The issues mentioned above can be significantly resolved by making vehicles smarter by reducing their reliance on humans. Over the past century, various nations have conducted extensive research that has fueled the automation of road vehicles. The development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies is currently being pursued by all significant motor manufacturers worldwide. Undoubtedly, the widespread use of autonomous cars is more imminent than we realize given the development of artificial intelligence (AI). In order for AVs to perceive their surroundings and make the right decisions in real time, AI has emerged as a crucial component. This development of AI is being driven by the growth of big data from numerous sensing devices and cutting-edge computing resources. We must first examine AI's development and history in order to comprehend its functions in AV systems.
