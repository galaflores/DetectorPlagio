Network news is an important way for netizens to get social information. Massive news information hinders netizens to get key information. Named entity recognition technology under artificial background can realize the classification of place, date and other information in text information. This article combines named entity recognition and deep learning technology. Specifically, the proposed method introduces an automatic annotation approach for Chinese entity triggers and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that can achieve high accuracy with a small number of training data sets. The method jointly trains sentence and trigger vectors through a trigger-matching network, utilizing the trigger vectors as attention queries for subsequent sequence annotation models. Furthermore, the proposed method employs entity labels to effectively recognize neologisms in web news, enabling the customization of the set of sensitive words and the number of words within the set to be detected, as well as extending the web news word sentiment lexicon for sentiment observation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the traditional BiLSTM-CRF model, achieving superior performance with only a 20% proportional training data set compared to the 40% proportional training data set required by the conventional model. Moreover, the loss function curve shows that my model exhibits better accuracy and faster convergence speed than the compared model. Finally, my model achieves an average accuracy rate of 97.88% in sentiment viewpoint detection.
