This article delves into the intricacies of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints. To address these issues, we leverage the power of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and employ adaptive methods to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters present in robotic dynamics. In the course of information exploration, the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are ever present due to limitations of distance and visual fields. In this regard, we introduce a general barrier function and prescribed performance methodology to tackle constrained range impediments effectively. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintain uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. With the aid of the dynamic surface technology, we propose a decentralized adaptive event-triggering fault-tolerant (ETFT) formation control strategy. We guarantee that all signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.
