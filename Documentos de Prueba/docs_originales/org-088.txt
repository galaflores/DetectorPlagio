The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly increasing in many Human Resources (HR) functions. This research aims to understand how diverse experts from distinct organisations, such as Project Managers, Managers, Supervisors and Human Resource Managers, perceive the potential of artificial intelligence-based recommender systems to match job profiles with employee profiles. This study employs a Delphi study-based methodology specifically, organising an expert panel that provides their opinions through their ratings and comments of a set of propositions. Based on the online Delphi study results and participant opinions, this research aims to identify the challenges related to employee-job profile matching through artificial intelligence and machine learning tools in the form of recommender systems. In this study, we have delved into the various challenges of matching employee profiles to job profiles and the current problems faced by executives, human resource personnel or supervisors such as project managers in an organisation. The study also sheds light on the potential or feasibility solutions of artificial intelligence in the form of recommender systems where we also test a couple of propositions that focus on potential solutions and various challenges for matching employee profiles to job profiles in an organisation.
