installed on the modern intelligent vehicles. Many Artificial Intelligence based foundation models have been proposed for smart sensing to recognize the known object classes in the new but similar scenarios. However, it is still challenging for the foundation models of smart sensing to detect all the object classes in both seen and unseen scenarios. This letter aims at pushing the boundary of smart sensing research for intelligent vehicles. We first summarize the current widely-used foundation models and the foundation intelligence needed for smart sensing of intelligent vehicles. We then explain Sora-based Parallel Vision to boost the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and final generalized intelligence (3.0). Several representative case studies are discussed to show the potential usages of Sora-based Parallel Vision, followed by its future research direction.
