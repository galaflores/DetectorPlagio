Since the 1950s, a significant number of clinical cases have confirmed the effectiveness of art in rehabilitation therapy and psychological interventions. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, AI painting software based on the Stable Diffusion algorithm model enables image creation through prompts and feedback. Therefore, whether AI painting software can positively impact human emotions becomes a critical factor for its application in art therapy. This study tracks and measures the emotional changes in patients before and after using the AI painting software Stable Diffusion WebUI using emotional vocabulary measurement methods. According to the experimental data of this project, artificial intelligence painting can leave a positive impression on human emotions. This result opens a new window for the integration of artificial intelligence with art therapy research. On one hand, it allows for the in-depth development of guided artificial intelligence painting software specifically designed as a dedicated tool for art therapy—a form of AI software for artistic healing. On the other hand, it encourages further research into the effectiveness of traditional painting versus AI-assisted painting in art therapy, aiming to explore the underlying principles and mechanisms of art therapy.
