The way healthcare is provided could be completely changed by the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV). AI-enhanced computer vision can be applied to medical picture analysis, disease detection, patient health monitoring, surgical assistance, drug discovery acceleration, and the creation of individualized treatment programs. Improved diagnosis, lower costs, personalized treatment, better patient outcomes, and quicker drug discovery are all advantages of employing AI-assisted computer vision in healthcare. However, the application of these technologies also presents difficulties in terms of data privacy, bias, and legal matters. The sorts of computer vision utilized in healthcare systems are discussed in this chapter, including medical image analysis, disease diagnosis, movement and gait analysis, surgical support, behavioral analysis, and medication discovery. The difficulties of employing computer vision in healthcare are also covered in the chapter, including data privacy concerns, bias, legal concerns, a lack of accessibility, and the complexity of biological systems. Overall, AI-assisted computer vision holds immense promise for revolutionizing healthcare systems by enabling quicker and more accurate diagnosis, enhancing patient outcomes, and cutting costs. To make sure that these technologies are used in an ethical and responsible manner, it is crucial to address the issues related to them.
