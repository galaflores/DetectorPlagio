Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind.
