With the unprecedented advancement of data aggregation and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to transform the practice of medicine. The field of orthopedics, in particular, is uniquely suited to harness the power of big data, and in doing so provide critical insight into elevating the many facets of care provided by orthopedic surgeons. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the recent and novel literature regarding ML in the field of orthopedics and to address its potential impact on the future of musculoskeletal care.
