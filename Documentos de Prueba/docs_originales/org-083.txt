This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the research and application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in recommender systems (RS). The study aims to identify recent trends, explore real-life applications, and guide researchers in positioning their research activities in this domain published in 2023 (Jan-June). The findings are categorized into different domains including education, healthcare, ML algorithms (auto-encoders and reinforcement learning), e-commerce, and digital journalism. The review highlights the enhanced recommendation accuracy, increased scalability, personalization and context awareness, diverse ML techniques, and strategies for handling cold start and data sparsity, and the foundation for future advancements in ML algorithms for RSs considering the application in manufacturing enterprises.
