The application of AI and machine learning, particularly the vision transformer method, in bacterial detection presents a promising solution to overcome limitations of traditional methods, offering faster and more accurate detection of disease-causing bacteria like E. coli and salmonella in water, crucial for human survival, with ongoing research to further assess its effectiveness in microbiology. This research introduces a revolutionary positional self-attention transformer model for the classification of bacterial colonies. Leveraging the proven success of transformer architectures in various domains, we enhanced the model's performance by integrating a positional self-attention mechanism. We presented a novel approach for bacterial colony classification utilizing a positional self-attention transformer model. This allows the model to effectively capture spatial relationships and patterns within bacterial colonies, contributing to highly accurate classification results. We trained the model on a substantial dataset of bacterial images, which ensures its robustness and generalization to diverse colony types. The proposed model adeptly captured the spatial relationships and sequential patterns inherent in bacterial colony images, allowing for more accurate and robust classification. The proposed model demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.50% in the classification of bacterial colonies. This novel approach surpasses traditional methods by effectively capturing intricate spatial relationships within microbial structures, offering unprecedented accuracy in discerning subtle morphological variations. The model's adaptability to diverse colony shapes and arrangements marks a significant advancement, promising to redefine the landscape of bacterial colony classification through the lens of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The high classification accuracy attained by the model, suggests its potential for practical applications in the early diagnosis of infectious diseases and the development of targeted treatments. The findings of this study underscore the effectiveness of incorporating positional self-attention in transformer models for image-based classification tasks, particularly in the domain of bacterial colony analysis.
