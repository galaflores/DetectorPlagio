In the evolving landscape of financial decision-making, this study delves into the intricate relationships among Emotional Intelligence (EI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Investment Decisions (ID). By scrutinizing the direct influence of human emotional intelligence on investment choices and elucidating the mediating role of AI in this process, our research seeks to unravel the complex interplay between minds and machines. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that EI not only directly impacts ID but also exerts its influence indirectly through AI-mediated pathways. The findings underscore the pivotal role of emotional awareness in investor decision-making, augmented by the technological capabilities of AI. It suggests that most investors are influenced by the identified emotional intelligence when making investment decisions. Furthermore, AI substantially impacts investors' decision-making process when it comes to investing; nevertheless, AI partially mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and investment decisions. This nuanced understanding provides valuable insights for financial practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the need for holistic strategies that integrate emotional and technological dimensions in navigating the intricacies of modern investment landscapes. As the synergy between human intuition and artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integral to financial decision-making, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the symbiotic relationship between minds and machines in investments
