This article delves into the intricacies of adaptive fuzzy event-triggered formation tracking control for nonholonomic multirobot systems characterized by infinite actuator faults and range constraints. Traditional cheating detection methods have many disadvantages, such as difficult to detect covert equipment cheating, multi-source cheating, difficult to distinguish plagiarists from plagiarists, difficult to distinguish plagiarists from victims, or plagiarism from coincidences. To address these issues, we leverage the power of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) and employ adaptive methods to approximate unknown nonlinear functions and uncertain parameters present in robotic dynamics. In the course of information exploration, the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance are ever present due to limitations of distance and visual fields. In this paper, the concept of knowledge point mastery Index is introduced to measure students’ mastery of a certain knowledge point, and a test method of cheating based on improved cognitive diagnostic model is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce the number of controller executions and compensate for any effect arising from infinite actuator failures, robots engage with their leader at the moment of actuator faults using fewer network communication resources yet maintain uninterrupted tracking of the desired trajectory generated by the leader. We guarantee that all signals are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Ultimately, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the ETFT control strategy for nonholonomic multirobot systems.The experiments show that the precision and recall rate of this method are significantly higher than those of the method based on the false-same rate, the method based on the false-same rate and the right-same rate and the method based on the Person-Fit index.
