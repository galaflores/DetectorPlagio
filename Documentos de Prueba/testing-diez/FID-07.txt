Human-AI interaction has become an important focus in developing technology that is more responsive and humane. In this context, the use of artificial empathy strategies is particularly interesting because of their potential to improve customer experiences affectively and socially. The aim of this research is to explore how artificial empathy strategies can optimize human-AI interactions and enhance affective and social customer experiences. The research approach is qualitative, involving a review of various studies and related literature. The data sources include journals, articles, and books relevant to the research topic. The research results indicate that implementing artificial empathy strategies in human-AI interactions has the potential to significantly improve the quality of interactions and customer experiences. Technologies such as natural language processing, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis can enable AI to respond more precisely and sensitively to user needs and emotions.
