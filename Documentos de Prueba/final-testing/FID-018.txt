The sphere of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is quite wide. 
Collaborative an individual technologies bases on AI are available nowadays. One of them is computer vision technology. Computer vision is also related to other technologies: Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial neural networks, etc. Computer vision is applied in many different areas. One of the areas where it has been widely applied in recent times is healthcare. In healthcare, various algorithms in the aforementioned technologies are used to obtain meaningful information from medical images. Computer vision, as a concept, and its fields of application, particularly in healthcare, are reviewed in this chapter. Also, the example of tumor detection by computer vision in a MATLAB environment is considered.
