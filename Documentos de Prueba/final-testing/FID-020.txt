Anti-plagiarism software are automated programmes and that help in improving the quality of submissions. But these tools must be used in conjunction with human intelligence and scrutiny. They are incapable of detecting certain forms of 
misconduct like contract cheating, manipulation of images, falsification, or data fabrication. It is strongly recommended that with the deployment of antiplagiarism software, sensitisation sessions be conducted to spread awareness 
about the detrimental effect of engaging in any kind of misconduct. The researchers need to be aware of the importance of the basic values of integrity and rigour in education and research.
