We explore gestures as interaction methods in virtual reality (VR). We detect hand and body gestures using human pose estimation based on off-the-shelf optical camera images using machine learning, and obtain reliable gesture recognition without additional sensors. We then employ an avatar to prompt users to learn and use gestures to communicate. Finally, to understand how well gestures serve as interaction methods, we compare the studied gesture-based interaction methods with baseline common interaction modalities in VR (controllers, gaze interaction) in a pilot study including usability testing.
