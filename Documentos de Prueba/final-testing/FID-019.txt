In this article, we propose a comparative analysis between previous approaches and the one using fuzzy logic. This article examines a solution to the major problems of induction machine control in order to achieve superior dynamic performance. Conventional direct torque control and indirect control with flux orientation have some drawbacks, such as current harmonics, torque ripples, flux ripples, and rise time. The demonstrated improvements in dynamic performance contribute to increased operational efficiency and reliability in industrial applications. Results from the simulation show that the direct torque control method using fuzzy logic is more effective in providing a precise and fast response without overshooting, and it eliminates torque and flux fluctuations at low switching frequencies.
