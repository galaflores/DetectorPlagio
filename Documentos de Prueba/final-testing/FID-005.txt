This paper firstly researches English text emotion expression and information communication, classifies English text emotion expression and information communication according to the human emotion-value relationship, and summarizes the characteristics of English emotion expression and information communication. Secondly, using artificial intelligence technology, it is proposed to construct an analysis model for English text emotion and information communication using the BiLSTM neural network. The remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in FER and the future directions for designing robust deep FER systems are also pinpointed.
To deal with the characteristics of English text quickly and efficiently, it is necessary to encode the emotional information of English text, and based on encoding, the BiLSTM neural network is applied to extract the emotional features of English text and solve the problem of the loss of emotional features through the loss function. Then, a comprehensive review of FER methods is introduced, including the basic principles of FER (components such as preprocessing, feature extraction and classification, and methods, etc.) from the pro-deep learning era (traditional methods using handcrafted features, i.e., SVM and HOG, etc.) to the deep learning era. The results show that compared with the original CNN, LSTM, and T-LSTM, the BiLSTM-based neural network performs better in the task of text emotion expression and information conveyance, with the accuracy rate staying above 0.925, and the effect on the English dataset is a bit better than that on the Chinese dataset. This study aims to enhance English teaching and communication between Chinese and foreign cultures.
