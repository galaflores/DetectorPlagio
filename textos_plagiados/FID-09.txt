Drug designing and development represent crucial areas of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, challenges such as low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost hinder progress in drug design and discovery. Additionally, the complexity and volume of data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials pose significant obstacles in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have revolutionized drug discovery and development, particularly through the use of artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms. These technologies have modernized various processes in drug discovery, including peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Historical evidence supports the implementation of AI and deep learning in drug discovery. Furthermore, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques have provided critical support to newly developed modeling algorithms. In summary, advancements in AI and deep learning offer significant opportunities for rational drug design and discovery, ultimately benefiting mankind.Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists.
